            <h2>Games:</h2>
            <p>We're on games this week so when 7:00 hits we'll lead everyone outside into a circle and I'll start praying afterwards
                we'll do the games you deciced on cat and mouse and sharks and minos and dynamite ball if we ran out  of games we'll do freeze tag
                and add another freezer when the time's almost over... 
                Assignment(optional) if you know or have any ideas for games we can do at kidsClub put them in the game channel "every idea is a good idea
                cause it can lead to another idea"-some tv show i saw awhile back

            <h2>Songs and Snack:</h2>
            <p>We're on songs next week try to find a time where you're all available sometime this week 
                and pick 3 songs and the order ya'll want to do them in I like to
                always end with "If you love Jesus" or "Father Abraham" it's not a requirement though it can get too repetitive sometimes
