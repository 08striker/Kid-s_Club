            <h2>Games:</h2>
            <p>
                We're on games in about 3 week so feel free to relax and focus on songs and snacks.
                When games start getting closer I'm thinking we can work on a list of games for different situations
                like for amount of kids, to kill the time and when the kid's aren't vibing with the game
                
                <strong>note:</strong> I think I'm gonna assign each of you to be in charge of a certain game to pick the kid's roles
                        and I'll kind of step in if any of y'all need help on something not entirly sure how i'm gonna do that yet
                        probably just assign you to the games you picked or something similar to that if you get any ideas
                        or have feedback on how this system might work let me know in the games channel
            </p>
