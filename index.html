            <h2>Songs and Snack:</h2>
            <p>We're on songs this week, either saturday(babtism) or sunday let's see if we can track down everyone on our team and pick 3 songs 
                and the order ya'll want to do them in I like to
                always end with "If you love Jesus" or "Father Abraham" it's not a requirement and it can get too repetitive sometimes
            </p>

            <h2>Teachings: </h2>
            <p>
                We have one more weeks left for teaching we'll be reading Exodus 14(THE RED SEA PARTS) 
                see if you have anytime this week(if you're busy next week works too) to storyrize Exodus 14 and post in the teachings channel
                also go over the roles you want to play as we can probably go over roles sunday or saturday so we can track down our entire team but
                you can kind of talk about it in the slack and get an idea of your lines and everything
            </p>

            <h2>Games:</h2>
            <p>
                We're on games in three week so feel free to relax and focus on songs and snacks.
                When games start getting closer I'm thinking we can work on a list of games for different situations
                like for amount of kids, to kill the time and when the kid's aren't vibing with the game
                
                <strong>note:</strong> I think I'm gonna assign each of you to be in charge of a certain game to like pick the kid's roles
                        and i'll kind of step in if any of y'all need help or something not entirly sure how i'm gonna do that yet
                        probably just assign you to whatever games you picked or something similar to that if you get any ideas
                        or have any feedback on this system let me know in the games channel
            </p>
